# Syndrome Validation Toolkit

This repository contains methods and scripts for the validation of syndrome definitions for syndromic surveillance systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

The purpose of this project is to document the process of creating, evaluating, and updating syndrome definitions for use in Georgia's State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SendSS). It helps ensure that syndrome definitions are:

- Scientifically valid and specific for Georgia
- Useful for monitoring public health trends
- Reliable for syndromic surveillance

Methods are adapted from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program's (NSSP) Community of Practice (CoP) [Syndrome Definition Development Toolkit](https://knowledgerepository.syndromicsurveillance.org/syndrome-definition-development-toolkit). While this process is recommended for national use, jurisdictions with local systems can also apply this toolkit to guide their own syndrome development practices.


## âœ… How to Use This Repository
